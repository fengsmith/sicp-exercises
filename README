I am reading Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, this time for real, I've tried before and for whatever reason I would procastinate till I forgot about it.

I've been recently investing some time in learning Lisp, Scheme and what they are all about, this book has been on my shelf for quite some time, plus, I've been recently wanting to pick up math, relearn what I forgot and learn properly what I barely remember.

So I will be using this repository to put the exercises I will be doing as I go through the book.
